           <br> -->
           <p>Karyn is a Clinical Mental Health Therapist with a Certificate in Sex Therapy.  Her passion is working with LGBTQIA+ and non-monogamous individuals, dyads and/or groups.  If you are the type of person that enjoys analyzing your process, from the mundane personal details to the wider social context that drives you, then Karyn is the therapist that can guide you in understanding how you work and how to bring yourself in line with your values.<br><br>

          Karyn focuses on general anxiety, depression, relationship and sexual trauma, general sex therapy, out of control sexual behaviors (“sex addiction”), avoidance, distress tolerance and coping skills, and identity development.  She utilizes a trauma-informed person-centered approach with cognitive behavioral therapy, attachment theory,  and other evidenced-based practices to educate and guide you on your journey towards a more congruent you.<br><br>
              
         The goal of therapy is to help you achieve growth, not to keep you dependent on services. Through the course of therapy, you can expect a systematic approach to guiding your development.  This may include utilizing assessments to provide a better understanding about your progress, or developing a value system to help guide you in achieving your goals. Waypoints are built into the therapy process to ensure progress towards goals is being made and provide time to reassess strategy or trajectory if needed. <br><br>
         Private pay clients will be charged based on income. I do not work with insurance companies, but I can provide you with a superbill, and you can check to see if your insurance company will reimburse you, though this is unlikely.
